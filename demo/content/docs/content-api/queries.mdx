GraphCMS automatically generates queries for fetching single, and multiple entries for each defined content type belonging to your project.

You will need a [Permanent Auth Token](/authorization#permanent-auth-tokens), or your [Public API Permissions](/authorization#public-api-permissions) configured to query any data from your project.

## Auto-generated queries

When a new model is added to your project, there are two generated GraphQL queries added to your schema. The queries are named after the `API ID`, and `Plural API ID`.

<Alert type="warning">


Both the single, and plural queries come with their own generated arguments for filtering, ordering, paginated, and getting content via their stage, revision, or locale.

</Alert>


For example, letâ€™s assume we have the model `Post` in our schema, and opted to keep the default generated API ID, and Plural API ID. The following queries would be generated by the API automatically:

- `post`
- `posts`
- `postVersion`
- `postsConnection`

## Fetching a single entry

The `post` query is what you would use to fetch one entry from the CMS.

You can fetch an individual entry by `id`, or any unique field defined in your content type.

```graphql
{
  post(where: { id: "..." }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

## Fetching multiple entries

The `posts` query is what you should use to fetch multiple entries from the CMS.

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
  }
}
```

## Fetching relations

Imagine `posts` have a [one to many](/schema/field-types#one-to-many) relation with comments. With GraphQL you can query the related `comments` in the same request.

Here we will get all posts, and their comments.

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    comments {
      id
      author
    }
  }
}
```

## Fetching locales

When fetching one or more entry, you can also fetch the localized entries. The default locale is set to `en`.

```graphql
{
  post(where: { id: "..." }, locales: [en, fr, de]) {
    title
  }

  posts(locales: [en, fr, de]) {
    title
  }
}
```

## Fetching stages

When fetching entries, you can also specify the content `stage`. The default content stage is set to `DRAFT`.

```graphql
{
  post(where: { id: "..." }, stage: PUBLISHED) {
    title
  }

  posts(stage: PUBLISHED) {
    title
  }
}
```

## Fetching versions

You can fetch all data of a specific entry at a point in time using the automatically generated version query.

For example, using the `postVersion` query from above, we can make a request to get the specific revision through a query:

```graphql
{
  articleVersion(where: { id: "abc123", revision: 1, stage: PUBLISHED }) {
    id
    revision
    data
  }
}
```

## Combining arguments

It is also possible to pass more than one query argument at a time.

For example, here we can get the first 3 posts, ordered by the created timestamp, where the title contains "GraphCMS", and is published.

```graphql
{
  posts(
    where: { title_contains: "GraphCMS" }
    orderBy: createdAt_DESC
    first: 3
    stage: PUBLISHED
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

- [Filtering](/content-api/filtering)
- [Ordering](/content-api/ordering)
- [Pagination](/content-api/pagination)
- [Content Stage](/content-api/coontent-stages)

## Combining queries

Multiple queries can be executed in parallel via a single request to your endpoint.

For example, let's fetch our a single, and multiple posts in one request.

```graphql
{
  post(where: { id: "..." }) {
    id
    title
  }

  posts {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

For example, here we query for all events, and alias a second query with `previous` to better represent the applied filter.

```graphql
{
  events(where: { start_gt: "2020-10-07T09:00:00+00:00" }) {
    start
  }

  previous: events(where: { start_lt: "2020-10-07T09:00:00+00:00" }) {
    start
  }
}
```

## Fetching with Relay

GraphCMS also implements the Relay specification for querying records for all projects. You can fetch a single entry using the `node` query, or multiple entries with the `postsConnection` type.

When fetching a single entry with `node`, you will need to also pass the Edge Type inside the query.

### Node

```graphql
{
  node(id: "...") {
    ... on Post {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

You can use the generated Relay connection query for querying multiple entries.

### Connection / Edges

```graphql
{
  postsConnection {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```
