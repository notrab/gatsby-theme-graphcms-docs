Safely work on isolated instances of your project with environments. Environments are for making changes to your schema, and testing out new content types without breaking your production implementation, not to be used for editorial workflows.

Depending on your current user role, and payment plan, you can manage your environments from your project settings.

Users, Roles & Permissions, Permanent Auth Tokens, and billing will not be cloned between projects.

## Create an environment

1. Navigate to the Settings tab in the left-hand sidebar in the lower group of icons.
2. Select "Environments" in the contextual.
3. Press "Clone" on the Master Environment.
4. Provide a display name, an environment alias (created automatically if not provided) and toggle whether you'd like to include the content from the master environment.

## Switching environments

You'll first need an additional environment to switch. Once you've more than one, click the "forking" icon in the sidebar, below your project icon. From here you can switch environments.

## Environment endpoints

Each environment has its own API endpoint, with the `alias` of the environment appended to the URL.

API endpoints for both `master` and `dev` environments would follow the format of:

<Tabs>
  <TabsItem label="master">


```bash
https://[region].graphcms.com/v2/[projectId]/master
```

  </TabsItem>
  <TabsItem label="dev">


```bash
https://[region].graphcms.com/v2/[projectId]/dev
```

  </TabsItem>
</Tabs>


## Delete an environment

1. Navigate to the Settings tab in the left-hand sidebar in the lower group of icons.
2. Select "Environments" in the contextual.
3. Find the environment you want to delete.
4. Press the delete button on the environment and confirm you want to delete.
