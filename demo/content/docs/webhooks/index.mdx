Use GraphCMS webhooks to get notified about events that happen in your project.

## Triggers

Triggers can be configured to listen to one or more content model, stage, and action events.

| Trigger       |                                                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content Model | All models, including `Asset`                                              |
| Stage         | Draft, Published, and [custom content stages](/content-api/content-stages) |
| Action        | Create, Update, Delete, Publish, and Unpublish                             |

## Receiving a webhook

Once an event occurs, data is sent as JSON in a POST requests body to the configured URL. The contents of the request always contain the `operation`, and `data` of the event.

Each event will also contain the `__typename`, `stage`, `localizations`, as well as the full content entry. The `id` and `__typename` of the related entries are also included.

The snapshot of the current stage is only sent in the webhook body. This means that:

- Create, Update, and Delete actions only send the draft version.
- Publishing, and Unpublishing actions only send the published version.

## Example payload

Below is an example of both `DRAFT`, and `PUBLISHED` content stage events.

In the examples below we have a `Post` model.
