Your schema is defined by the models you create, and [fields](/schema/field-types) you add. Inside the schema editor, you can add fields, create relationships between models, and much more.

All changes to your schema are immediately available via GraphQL.

## Settings

All models have the following attributes:

| Attribute     | Example      | Description                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display name  | `Post`       | The name displayed inside GraphCMS, and content editors.        |
| API ID        | `Post`       | The name for fetching a single entry                            |
| Plural API ID | `Posts`      | The name for fetching multiple entries                          |
| Description   | `Blog posts` | Optional hint for content editors when interacting with fields. |

GraphCMS will automatically scaffold default values for `API ID`, and `Plural API ID` based on the `Display name`. These values will be available via the API as camel case.

For example, letâ€™s assume we have the model `Post` above. The following queries, and mutations would be generated by the API automatically:

- `post`
- `posts`
- `postVersion`
- `postsConnection`
- `createPost`
- `updatePost`
- `deletePost`
- `upsertPost`
- `publishPost`
- `unpublishPost`
- `updateManyPostsConnection`
- `deleteManyPostsConnection`
- `publishManyPostsConnection`
- `unpublishManyPostsConnection`

## Preview URLs

It's most common to create a preview URL for models that represent a page, and have a field such as a slug.

The fields on your model are available to use within the URL template. For example, a `Post` model may have the following preview URLs:

| Preview name | URL template                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Production` | `https://graphcms.com/blog/:slug`         |
| `Staging`    | `https://staging.graphcms.com/blog/:slug` |
