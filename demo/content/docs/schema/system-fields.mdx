All default, and custom content types come with some managed system fields. These fields reflect certain states of your content, such as when it was last updated, or published at.

## Default model fields

These fields are included with all content models you create within GraphCMS.

| Field         | Type        | Description                                        |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | `Integer!`  | Unique for each content entry                      |
| `createdAt`   | `DateTime!` | Timestamp for when the content entry was created   |
| `updatedAt`   | `DateTime!` | Timestamp for when the content entry was updated   |
| `publishedAt` | `DateTime!` | Timestamp for when the content entry was published |

## Asset fields

Since the Asset model is included with every project, it also comes with some predefined fields, as well as all of the system fields above.

The Asset field type has all of the [default fields](/schema/system-fields#default-fields), as well as:

| Field           | Type        | Description                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`           | `String!`   | The URL of the asset, with any [transformations](/content-api/assets#transformations). |
| `handle`        | `String!`   | The file handle.                                                                       |
| `fileName`      | `String!`   | The document file name that was uploaded.                                              |
| `height`        | `Float`     | The height of the file (for images only).                                              |
| `width`         | `Float`     | The width of the file (for images only).                                               |
| `size`          | `Float`     | The total file size.                                                                   |
| `mimeType`      | `String`    | The mime type of the file.                                                             |
| `locale`        | `Locale!`   | The system locale enumeration for your projects locales. E.g. `en`, `de`.              |
| `localizations` | `[Asset!]!` | An array of localized assets for the asset you are querying.                           |

Asset fields are localized by default, and always include the localization fields described below.

## Localization fields

When you localize fields within GraphCMS, the model will be updated to contain the following fields:

| Field           | Type            | Description                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `locale`        | `Locale!`       | The system locale enumeration for your projects locales. E.g. `en`, `de`. |
| `localizations` | `[modelName!]!` | An array of localized entries for the model you are querying.             |

## Connection type fields

Since GraphCMS implements the Relay specification, when [fetching with Relay](/content-api/queries#fetching-with-relay) you will have some fields made available to you automatically.

For example, let's imagine we have the model `Post`. The `postsConnection` would look a little something like:

| Field       | Type           | Description                                       |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `edges`     | `[PostEdge!]!` | A list of edges, containing cursor, and the node. |
| `pageInfo`  | `PageInfo!`    | Information used for paginating nodes.            |
| `aggregate` | `Aggregate!`   | The count of records, relative to any filters.    |

### `[PostEdge!]!`

| Field    | Type      | Description                                                   |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cursor` | `String!` | The edge cursor, used for paginating records.                 |
| `node`   | `Post!`   | The actual entry of the record, for example the `Post` entry. |

```graphql
{
  postsConnection {
    edges {
      cursor
      node {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### `PageInfo!`

GraphCMS exposes the `PageInfo` type on the field `pageInfo` for connection queries. This is useful with cursor based pagination.

| Field             | Type       | Description                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `hasNextPage`     | `Boolean!` | When paginating forwards, are there more items?   |
| `hasPreviousPage` | `Boolean!` | When paginating backwards, are there more items?  |
| `startCursor`     | `String`   | When paginating backwards, the cursor to continue |
| `endCursor`       | `String`   | When paginating forwards, the cursor to continue  |
| `pageSize`        | `Int`      | The number of items in the current page           |

```graphql
{
  postsConnection {
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
      startCursor
      endCursor
      pageSize
    }
  }
}
```

### `Aggregate!`

It is possible using the connection type query to perform an aggregate count.

| Field   | Type   | Description                                           |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `count` | `Int!` | The count of results matching the query, and filters. |

      count
    }
