All default, and custom content types come with some managed system fields. These fields reflect certain states of your content, such as when it was last updated, or published at.

## Default fields

| `id`          | `Integer!`  | Unique for each content entry                      |
| `createdAt`   | `DateTime!` | Timestamp for when the content entry was created   |
| `updatedAt`   | `DateTime!` | Timestamp for when the content entry was updated   |
| `publishedAt` | `DateTime!` | Timestamp for when the content entry was published |
