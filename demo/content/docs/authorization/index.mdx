Queries and mutations by default require a [Permanent Auth Token](#permanent-auth-tokens) token, but you can configure the [Public API Permissions](#public-api-permissions) to allow unauthenticated requests.

GraphCMS allows you to configure access to each stage, environment, and whether or not you permit mutations.

## Public API Permissions

By default all new projects disable public API access. You can enable queries from your content stages, as well as specifying the default stage in which data is queried from.

Since all new content entries use `DRAFT` as the default stage, you will need to enable querying drafts before you can enable mutations.

<Alert type="warning">


Enabling public access to your project means that anybody with your API endpoint can query sensitive data, and perform destructive actions.

## Permanent Auth Tokens

Permanent Auth Tokens are used for controlling access to querying, mutating content, and comes in the form of Bearer token authentication.

Similar to Public API permissions, you can create individual PATs for specific API actions.

Some users create PATs for only querying data from the draft stage. You may also opt to create a PAT for mutations.

If you are mutating data from the frontend, you should hide this token at the server level, and not expose your PAT client-side.

The Permanent Auth Token must be passed via the `Authorization` header on HTTP requests in the format of a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer PERMANENT_AUTH_TOKEN
```

## API Endpoint

Each GraphCMS project you create, or are invited to, has a unique GraphQL API endpoint. This single endpoint permits you to both query, and mutate data within your project.

GraphQL introspection is enabled by default, so anybody with access to your endpoint can traverse the graph to see your content types, as well as all queries and mutations.

The API endpoint also contains the current schema [environment](/getting-started/environments), by default this will be `master`.

Your endpoint will look something like:

```
https://[region].graphcms.com/v2/[projectId]/[environment]
```
