GraphCMS uses conventional HTTP responses codes when returning API requests.

Codes in the 2xx range refer to a successful request, whereas responses in the 4xx range indicate there was an error due to the information you provided, such as invalid [query arguments](content-api/queries#query-arguments), or [auth](/authorization) token.

| Code  | Description                                                       |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200` | OK - Successful response                                          |
| `400` | Bad request - Typically due to invalid query arguments            |
| `401` | Unauthorized - Usually no valid Permanent Auth Token was provided |
| `404` | Not Found - Typically invalid endpoint or environment requested   |
| `429` | Too Many Requests - You're making too many requests, slow down    |
| `500` | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong our side             |

A typical GraphQL error will look like the below. The format of the error is typical for any `400` query or mutation request.

```graphql
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "input:1: Field \"idd\" is not defined by type PostWhereInput. Did you mean id?\n"
    }
  ],
  "data": null,
  "extensions": {
    "requestId": "ckff8k1tc0nsg0150cssdkzxm"
  }
}
```

It's clear from the error above that the field `idd` is not part of the [Input Type](schema/input-types).

<Alert type="info">


GraphCMS will also return the `requestId` which can be used when requesting support.
