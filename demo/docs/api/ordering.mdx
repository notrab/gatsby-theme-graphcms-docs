When fetching multiple entries you can use the `orderBy` argument to define the order of the returned records.

You can order results by all [System Fields](/schema/system-fields#asset-fields), and any non-relational custom field you define in your model, either ascending, or descending.

## Order by types

| Input Type         | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `[fieldName]_ASC`  | Order results by `fieldName` ascending.  |
| `[fieldName]_DESC` | Order results by `fieldName` descending. |

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeBlock label="ASC" active>


```graphql
{
  posts(orderBy: createdAt_ASC) {
    id
    createdAt
  }
}
```

  </CodeBlock>
  <CodeBlock label="DESC">


```graphql
{
  posts(orderBy: createdAt_DESC) {
    id
    createdAt
  }
}
```

  </CodeBlock>
</CodeGroup>


## Nested ordering

You can also use the `orderBy` with any nested relations. For example, let's imagine our post has a `authors` relation. The same `orderBy` rules apply.

```graphql
{
  posts {
    id
    createdAt
    authors(orderBy: createdAt_DESC) {
      id
      createdAt
    }
  }
}
```
